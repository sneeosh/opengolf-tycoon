| **Resort** | Highest fees + highest costs | Premium prestige |

## Recommended Additions

### 1. HEATHLAND (Strong Recommendation)

**What it is:** The classic "middle ground" between Links and Parkland. Inland courses on sandy, well-drained soil with heather, gorse, and scattered pine trees. Famous examples: Sunningdale, Walton Heath, Wentworth, The Berkshire.

**Why it's distinct:** Neither the coastal wind of Links nor the lush tree-lined fairways of Parkland. The defining hazard is the *rough itself* — heather and gorse are brutally penal, turning even short misses into bogeys. Fairways feel narrow because the penalty for missing them is so severe.

**Visual identity:**
- Purple/brown heather rough instead of green rough
- Sandy, golden-brown soil tones (firmer than Parkland)
- Scattered pine clusters and birch trees (not dense forest)
- Deep pot bunkers that blend into the landscape
- Muted, earthy palette — browns, purples, sandy golds

**Gameplay modifiers:**
- Wind: ~1.2x (moderate, inland but open)
- Distance: 1.01x (firm turf gives extra roll)
- Maintenance: 0.75x (heathland is low-maintenance by nature)
- Green fee: $35 (premium but not luxury)
- Land cost: 1.1x (desirable heathland is limited)
- **Unique mechanic — Penal rough:** Heavy rough penalty significantly worse than other themes. Misses into heather should cost 0.5–1.0 strokes more than typical heavy rough. Could implement as a recovery skill modifier (e.g., recovery effectiveness reduced by 20–30% in heathland rough).

**Why add it:** Fills a genuine gap in the course archetype spectrum. Creates a gameplay niche around *accuracy over power* — the course isn't hard because of wind or elevation, it's hard because you must hit fairways. Visually distinctive with the purple heather palette.

### 2. WOODLAND (Strong Recommendation)

**What it is:** Dense forest courses carved through pine or hardwood forests. Tight, tree-lined fairways where accuracy is paramount. Famous examples: Pinehurst No. 2, Pine Needles, Augusta National (pine-heavy sections), Pine Valley.

**Why it's distinct:** While Parkland has scattered trees, Woodland courses are *defined* by dense tree corridors. The trees aren't decoration — they're the primary hazard. Shot shaping (draws/fades) and club selection matter enormously. Recovery shots from tree trouble are a core skill test.

**Visual identity:**
- Dense, dark pine forest surrounding fairways
- Pine needle/pine straw ground cover (brown-orange) instead of rough
- Narrower visible fairway corridors
- Fewer bunkers (trees do the punishing)
- Dappled, darker overall palette — deep greens and browns
- Minimal water features

**Gameplay modifiers:**
- Wind: 0.8x (trees block wind significantly)
- Distance: 0.98x (dense air, trees limit club choices)
- Maintenance: 0.9x (natural forest, less landscaping)
- Green fee: $35
- Land cost: 0.7x (forested land is affordable)
- **Unique mechanic — Tree density:** Significantly more tree obstacles. Errant shots have high probability of hitting trees, requiring recovery shots. Could increase tree collision chance by 40–50% compared to Parkland. Shot AI would need to factor in tight corridors more aggressively.

**Why add it:** Creates the most *tactically different* gameplay. Players must design holes with wider corridors to be fair, or lean into the difficulty. Golfer satisfaction becomes about the challenge-reward balance of threading shots through trees. Visually very different from the open feel of most other themes.

### 3. TROPICAL (Moderate Recommendation)

**What it is:** Wild, oceanfront tropical island courses with volcanic rock, coral, jungle rough, and trade winds. Think Hawaii (Mauna Kea, Kapalua), Caribbean (Teeth of the Dog, Corales). Distinct from Resort in that it's rugged and natural rather than manicured and luxurious.

**Why it's distinct from Resort:** Resort is about premium manicured luxury (white sand, lagoons, hibiscus). Tropical is about dramatic natural terrain — volcanic rock out-of-bounds, jungle rough, ocean carry holes, and persistent trade winds. Resort is a 5-star hotel course; Tropical is an adventure course.

**Visual identity:**
- Black/dark volcanic rock (OOB and hazard areas)
- Bright turquoise ocean (more vivid than Resort's lagoons)
- Dense jungle green for rough (darker, wilder than Resort)
- Coral-sand bunkers (pinkish-white)
- Vivid contrast between lush fairway and barren lava/rock

**Gameplay modifiers:**
- Wind: 1.4x (persistent trade winds, less than Links but constant)
- Distance: 1.02x (warm sea-level air)
- Maintenance: 1.2x (tropical growth requires constant management)
- Green fee: $45 (destination premium)
- Land cost: 1.4x (island real estate)
- **Unique mechanic — Forced carries:** More water/rock hazards that require carrying over. Course design naturally creates risk-reward ocean holes. OOB areas are lava/rock (no recovery, full penalty).

**Why add it:** Provides a visually striking theme that's distinct from everything else. The lava rock + ocean + jungle combination creates a unique palette. Gameplay-wise, it splits the difference between Links (wind) and Resort (premium) with its own forced-carry identity. However, there is some overlap with Resort, so this is a "nice to have" rather than essential.

### 4. MARSHLAND / LOWCOUNTRY (Moderate Recommendation)

**What it is:** Coastal lowland courses built around marshes, wetlands, and tidal areas. Famous examples: Kiawah Island (Ocean Course), Harbour Town, Sea Island. Defined by omnipresent water, marsh grass, Spanish moss-draped oaks, and strategic routing around wetlands.

**Why it's distinct:** No other theme makes *water* the dominant hazard at this scale. Links has coastal wind; Marshland has water *everywhere* — marsh, creeks, ponds, tidal inlets. The course design challenge becomes routing holes through and around wetlands.

**Visual identity:**
- Marsh grass (golden-green reeds) bordering fairways
- Muddy brown/grey water (not the clean blue of other themes)
- Spanish moss on live oak trees (grey-green draped canopy)
- Soft, muted color palette — sage greens, tans, grey-browns
- Lots of visible water/wetland tiles throughout the map

**Gameplay modifiers:**
- Wind: 1.3x (coastal, open terrain)
- Distance: 1.0x
- Maintenance: 1.1x (drainage and environmental management)
- Green fee: $40
- Land cost: 0.5x (swamp/marshland is cheap)
- **Unique mechanic — Water prevalence:** Significantly more water hazards generated naturally. Water penalty areas border many fairways. Environmental constraint on where holes can be routed. Cheap land but expensive to develop (high building placement constraints near water).

**Why add it:** Offers genuinely different course design puzzle — the player must work *around* the water rather than just placing it. Visually, the marsh/lowcountry aesthetic (sage, tan, grey-brown) is unlike anything in the current palette. Gameplay creates a unique "cheap land, hard to build" economic dynamic.

## Not Recommended

### Sandbelt
Australian-specific (Melbourne Sandbelt). Sandy soil, creative bunkering, excellent drainage. Too similar to Heathland/Links in gameplay feel. Would be hard to differentiate visually or mechanically. Better as a future "regional variant" of Heathland if the game ever adds sub-themes.

### Snow / Winter
Novelty value only. Real snow golf exists but is extremely niche. Frozen ponds, white terrain, limited vegetation. Could work as a seasonal event or cosmetic, but not as a full course type with meaningful gameplay differentiation. A better implementation would be the planned seasonal calendar system affecting Mountain courses in winter.

### Stadium / Championship
These are layout/format types, not terrain types. A "stadium course" can be any terrain type. Better implemented as a tournament venue upgrade or building type rather than a separate theme.

### Executive / Par-3
These are course *length* formats, not terrain styles. Better implemented as a course configuration option (number of holes, par range) rather than a theme.

## Priority Summary

| Theme | Priority | Gameplay Niche | Visual Distinction | Overlap Risk |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Heathland** | High | Penal rough / accuracy | Purple heather, sandy soil | Low (unique niche) |
| **Woodland** | High | Tree corridors / shot shaping | Dark pine forest, narrow corridors | Low-Med (some Parkland overlap) |
| **Tropical** | Medium | Forced carries / volcanic terrain | Lava rock + ocean + jungle | Med (Resort overlap) |
| **Marshland** | Medium | Water everywhere / routing puzzle | Marsh grass, muddy water, oaks | Low (unique niche) |

Adding Heathland and Woodland would bring the roster to 8 themes covering essentially all major real-world golf course archetypes. Adding Tropical and Marshland on top of that would bring it to 10 and cover virtually every distinct course style worth modeling.
