1. Placing terrain objects of different types
2. Creating holes and greens
3. Tracking those holes in the hole register
4. Adding buildings
5. Adding trees (4 types: Oak, Pine, Maple, Birch) and decorative rocks (3 sizes)
6. Budget tracking - adding objects subtracts from overall budget
7. Golfer AI framework with basic shot calculation
8. **Ball physics and visualization system** - Arc trajectory for full shots, ground roll for putts, terrain-based physics
9. **Golfer visual rendering** - Animated golfers with walking/swinging animations and score tracking
10. **Hole visualization system** - Visual flags, connecting lines, hole info labels with par and yardage
11. **Play/Pause system with golfer spawning** - Game mode switching with validation and automatic golfer spawning
12. **Complete shot system with club types** - Driver, Iron, Wedge, Putter with terrain modifiers
13. **Intelligent golfer AI** - Smart target selection, hazard avoidance, personality traits, terrain-aware pathfinding
14. Intuitive camera controls with arrow keys moving in visual direction
15. **Green fee system** - Configurable green fees ($10-$200), golfers pay on spawn with floating notification
16. **Dynamic golfer spawning** - Groups spawn when first tee is clear, with group sizes weighted by green fee
17. **Turn-based group play** - Groups play holes turn-based with tee order and "away" rules, par 3 safety holds, deadlock prevention
18. **Calibrated game time** - 1 real minute = 1 game hour at normal speed; FAST (2x) and ULTRA (4x) scale proportionally
19. **Hole management** - Open/close holes, delete holes with renumbering, golfers skip closed holes
20. **Undo/Redo in build mode** - Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y for terrain painting and entity placements with cost refund

## Known Bugs

### Critical
- None currently! All critical bugs have been resolved.

### Fixed (Completed)
- ✅ Clicking plant tree causes the game to crash - Fixed by renaming Tree class to TreeEntity
- ✅ Placing rocks doesn't work - Fully implemented with 3 size options
- ✅ Arrow key camera movement is isometric instead of intuitive - Now moves in visual screen direction
- ✅ Landing zone check was blocking within the same group instead of only other groups
- ✅ Golfer accuracy too low - increased skill range to 0.5-0.9 and reduced error spread
- ✅ Round finish bug - golfers now properly clear the final green
- ✅ Groups deadlocking each other on par 3s - fixed with directional blocking and par 3 holds
- ✅ Ball flight not visible - BallManager failed to create ball on first shot; fixed by adding from_position to ball_landed signal and using get_or_create_ball
- ✅ Golfer/ball tile offset - entities positioned at tile corner instead of center; added grid_to_screen_center helper
- ✅ Infinite putting loop - putts never converged toward hole, blocking next group's tee shots; fixed with gimme range, short putts aim at hole, off-green putts stop at green edge
- ✅ Putter shots flying in arc like wedge shots - putts now roll along the ground with club-aware animation
- ✅ Landing zone deadlock from stuck putters - added putt accuracy floor (95% short, 75% long) and double-par pickup rule
- ✅ Too many groups spawning at once - tightened first tee clear check to also block when golfers are mid-action (walking, preparing, swinging, watching) on hole 0
- ✅ Golfers hitting from green instead of walking to next tee - reset current_strokes after hole-out and added walk-to-tee logic for subsequent holes
- ✅ Walk-to-tee broke first-hole spawning - added first-hole exemption so golfers teleport to tee on hole 1

### Minor
- (Add bugs as discovered)
